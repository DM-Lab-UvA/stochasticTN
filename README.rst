Tensor Networks for Stochastic Models
-------------------------------------

Harvesting the power of tensor networks for representing high-dimensional probability distributions of stochastic systems.
This code forms the base for the computations performed in the paper:
  
  | **Efficient simulations of epidemic models with tensor networks: application to the one-dimensional SIS model**
  | Wout Merbis, Cl√©lia de Mulatier, Philippe Corboz
  | `arxiv/2305.06815 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06815>`_

We refer to there and the example jupyter notebook ``Examples.ipynb`` for more information (for now) as the project remains under active development.
